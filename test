  - How images are tagged.  
  - Using a **single image for multi-environment deployments**.  
- Knowledgeable in **application configuration management**, including:  
  - Using **App Settings** for environment-specific configurations.  
  - Attaching runtime configurations to containers using **ConfigMaps**.  
- Experienced in **securing applications** using **Azure Key Vault** to manage secrets.  
- Familiar with **tracking code changes based on Build ID** to ensure traceability in the deployment process.  
- Has a **clear understanding of troubleshooting application issues**, including:  
  - Identifying and analyzing **container logs** to debug application errors.  
  - Checking **Service Bus** for message failures or delays.  
  - Investigating **resource metrics and diagnostics** to pinpoint failures in the application flow.  
  - Debugging **configuration issues** related to environment-specific deployments.

  - Working with **Fortify** and **Snyk (DAST)** for security scanning.  
  - Understanding **SecOps workflows** and integrating security into the DevOps process.  
- **Lacks experience in Azure infrastructure management**, specifically:  
  - How **Managed Identity** is assigned to a pod.  
  - The process of **App Registration** creation and its role in authentication.  
  - How to **upgrade a Kubernetes cluster**, as the infrastructure is managed by a different team in their current project.  
- **Coding ability assessment:**  
  - The candidate attempted a **simple loop coding exercise** but was **unable to write the code without the help of ChatGPT**.  
  - However, they were able to write a **similar exercise in Python** when given guidance.  
- Strong expertise in **Azure DevOps**, but has **limited exposure to GitHub Actions**.  

## Overall  
The candidate has a solid foundation in **DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, application security, and SecOps workflows**. Their **experience with Fortify, Snyk (DAST), and security integration** is a strong plus. However, they **lack hands-on experience with Azure infrastructure** and **struggled with independent coding**. They would be a good fit for **CI/CD, security-focused DevOps roles**, but may need **upskilling in Azure infrastructure management and coding skills**.
